The goal of this project is to improve Optical Character Recognition technology's accuracy, which is used to transform scanned photos or handwritten text into machine- readable text. In a number of industries, the proposed system think that by increasing Optical Character Recognition accuracy, it can boost productivity, decrease errors, and save priceless time and resources.
The proposed system is looking into a number of methods to accomplish this, including deep learning, picture preprocessing, language- specific Optical Character Recognition, and hybrid Optical Character Recognition. The proposed system intend to increase the recognition accuracy of text by combining these methods. The proposed system anticipate the outcomes of our work and are pleased about the possibility for these strategies to have a positive impact on both our project and society.
